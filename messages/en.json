        "question": "What are the potential effects or perceived benefits of CBD?",
        "answer": "Users often report a feeling of relaxation, stress management improvement, or better sleep. However, CBD is not a medicine and is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. Effects can vary from person to person. We make no therapeutic claims."
      },
      "q7": {

        "question": "Can CBD flowers or resins be smoked?",
        "answer_emphasis": "No.",

      },
      "q18": {
        "question": "What CBD dosage should I take?",

Whether in the form of oil, balm, or infusion, we were all convinced of the incredible potential of this molecule derived from hemp.",
